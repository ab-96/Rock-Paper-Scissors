# My Design
This game as desgined in figma first, I used CSS grid to dynamically position all the elements on the page. The elements resposivey postion while in mobile view. 

# How it works
The user has three options: rock, paper and scissors. The person that plays the strongest “object” is the winner of the game. As soon as the user makes their choice, the computer will make it's chose too. The program will then determine who won the round. The game will end when eithet the user or the computer's score reaches 3.
